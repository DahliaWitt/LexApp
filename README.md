# LexApp

### Local Government at your fingertips.

LexApp is a mobile application that connects to Legistar in order to make civic data more accessible on mobile platforms.

## Getting Started

The mobile application is built with the Ionic Framework.

### Prerequisites

Install NodeJS

Install Ionic and Cordova:
```
npm install -g ionic cordova
```

### Running

Use ionic to run in the browser

```
ionic serve
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:8100

Note: There may be a CORS issue. I fixed this by installing a Chrome extension to turn off CORS for localhost, but you may also opt to make a proxy.


### Building for iOS or Android

Refer to the Ionic Framework [Documentation](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started/)
